ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Divij (@bhatiadivij)

I love bringing ideas to life. Currently, I'm a software developer at Amazon and I work on solving cutting edge NP-Hard problems.

Being an avid learner, I love exploring new technologies which help me to build better software with clean, efficient and scalable code. Adding to that, I am a firm believer of experiential learning and I'm always open to working with people who bring out the best in me. Apart from work, I am a hobbyist photographer.
